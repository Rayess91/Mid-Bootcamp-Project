**DA - Music & Mental Health**



Why  ?

Personal Interest: Music and its different genres is a subject that deeply interest me, and I believe there's a significant intersection between music genres, mental health and type of personalities that warrants exploration.

Relevance: Mental health is a critical issue globally, and understanding how music impacts mental well-being could have practical implications for various fields such as psychology, therapy, and music education.



What ?

This project aims to analyze a dataset on music and mental health to investigate potential correlations, patterns, and insights regarding how music consumption habits relate to mental complications and the impact of music on the psychological symptoms.

Goals:
- Identify correlations between music listening habits, preferences, and mental health indicators.
- Explore potential causal relationships or associations between specific music genres, age of respondent, engagement levels and mental health outcomes.
